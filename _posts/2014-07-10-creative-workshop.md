Being creative is hard, especially when you're up against a tight schedule. We don't really have time to just be creative for the sake of it, so we're making time.

Together with [Molly Inglish](https://twitter.com/mollyinglish), I run a [workshop](http://www.meetup.com/creativeworkshop-sf/) to practice and teach design thinking. Based on David Sherwin's book "Creative Workshop", here are some of the guiding philosophies of what we're hoping to achieve: 

* Being creative takes practice. 
* 'Failure' is a required component of creativity. 
* Process is more important than the final product. 
* Rote repetition rarely leads to design intuition. 
* Add constraints, gain creativity. 

Each Meetup, we will work through a different creative challenge, generally between 20-50 minutes in length, and discuss one creative problem-solving technique when implementing design thinking at work/play.
